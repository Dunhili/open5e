Aarakocra Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an aarakocra, you have certain traits in common
with your people. Being able to fly at high speed
starting at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain
circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others.
As a result, playing an aarakocra requires special
consideration by your DM.

The small colonies of aarakocra are insular and remote,
and few aarakocra live away from their roosts. In the Star
