Aasimar (Volo)

Angelic Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an
angelic being. That being - usually a deva - provides guidance to the
aasimar; though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the
guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the
aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.

The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its
understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight
into combating especially powerful evil that it knows about.

As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that
character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide offer names and natures that
you can use to flesh out your character's guide.

or spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level.

Scourge Aasimar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them.
It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil - a desire that is, at its best,

block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only
in battle.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Radiant Consumption.** Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the

During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you
take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each
of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to
it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. 

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant
you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see must succeed on a
Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or
become :ref:`srd:frightened` of you until the end of your next turn. 

Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action.
