Dwarf Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and
parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're
considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live
about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the
benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with
a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share
in the benefits of a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about
150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not
reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
	
**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency with the battleaxe,

your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.

**Stonecunning.** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check
related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the
History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check,
instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.
Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those
characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might
speak.

resilience.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score also increases by 1.

using only the spell's enlarge option. When you reach 5th level,
you can cast the :ref:`srd:invisibility` spell on yourself once
with this trait. You don't need material components for either spell,
and you can't cast them while you're in direct sunlight, although
