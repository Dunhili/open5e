Elf Traits
^^^^^^^^^^

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of
thousands of years of elven refinement.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age
as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical
growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims
adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750
years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so
they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and
protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often
good than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have
slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being
:ref:`srd:charmed`, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such
meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a
fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become
reflexive through years of practice.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does
from 8 hours of sleep.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.
Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven
literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous
among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

High Elf
^^^^^^^^

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics
of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high
elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be
superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more
common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other
races.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score also increases by 1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword,
shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell
list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write one extra language
of your choice.

Wood Elf
^^^^^^^^

As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet foot carry
you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score also increases by 1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword,
shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Fleet of Foot.** Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

**Mask of the Wild.** You can attempt to hide even when you are only
lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other
natural phenonema.

Dark Elf (Drow)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished
from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and
corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark,
patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that
resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very
pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red,
and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score also increases by 1.

**Superior Darkvision.** Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you
are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

**Drow Magic.** You know the :ref:`srd:dancing-lights` cantrip. When you reach 3rd level,
you can cast the :ref:`srd:faerie-fire` spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you
can also cast the :ref:`srd:darkness` spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability
for these spells.

**Drow Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the rapiers, shortswords,
and hand crossbows.

Eladrin (DMG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of
the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly
in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score also increases by 1.

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword,
shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Fey Step.** You can cast the :ref:`srd:misty-step` spell once using this trait.
You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.

Eladrin (MToF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion,
and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has
coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood.

**Spring** is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.

**Summer** is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.

**Autumn** is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.

**Winter** is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.

Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other
eladrin transform, adoping characteristics of a new season. 

**Spring**

**Ability Score Increase.** Your charisma score also increases by 1.

**Seasons.** Each Eladrin is associated with a particular season. When making an Eladrin, choose your season:
Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter. You may choose to change your season at the end of a long rest.

**Fey Step.** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 3rd level,
your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the
DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

* **Spring** When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature
  then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.
* **Summer** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet
  of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).
* **Autumn** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within
  10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your
  companions deal any damage to it.
* **Winter** When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before
  you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Moon Elf (SCAG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same stats as a High Elf.

Sun Elf (SCAG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same stats as a High Elf.

Sea Elf (MToF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves
traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters across a hundred
worlds. Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows and on the elemental Plane of Water.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Sea Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the spear, trident, light crossbow, and net.

**Child of the Sea.** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.

**Friend of the Sea.** Using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts that have an inborn swimming speed.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Aquan.

Shadar-Kai (MToF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell
to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life
and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Necrotic Resistance.** You have resistance to necrotic damage.

**Blessing of the Raven Queen.** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 
Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all
damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear
ghostly and translucent.

Rare Elf Subraces (SCAG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other lines of descendants exist of the elves who originally came to Faerun, but
they are so rare as to be legendary, often considered mythical.

**Avariel.** The *Aril'Tel'Quessir*, or winged elves, were among the first to
settle in Faerun. They are famed for thier feathered wings and ability to fly.
Ancient conflicts with dragons nearly wiped them out, and today they are rarely,
if ever, seen.

**Lythari.** The *Ly'Tel'Quessir* have the ability to polymorph into wolves. Unlike
werewolves, lythari don't have a hybride form and aren't afflicted by a curse. They
dwell together in secretive packs, primarily in wolf form, living free in the deep
wilds of the world.

**Sea Elves.** The *Alu'Tel'Quessir* ("water-elves") are an aquatic subrace of elves
found in the oceans of the world, especially off the shores of Faerun and Evermeet.
Sea elves live along the sword coast in close-knit nomadic clans, but elsewhere sea
elves claim kingdoms in sun-lit shallwos. They have been at war with the sahuagin
throughout their history.

**Star Elves.** The star elves, or *Ruar'Tel'Quessir* look much like tall moon elves.
They dwell on the demiplane of Sildeyuir near the Feywild. A conflict with the nilshai,
a race of wormlike sorcerers from the Ethereal Plane, forced some star elves to leave their
home and come to Faerun.

**Wild Elves.** The *Sy'Tel'Quessir* are considered by many elves to be the most strange of their
race, having abandoned or lost much of their ancient culture.
