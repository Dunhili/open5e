Genasi Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your genasi character has certain characteristics in
common with all other genasi.

**Genasi Backgrounds.** Each genasi subrace has its own temperament,
which might make some backgrounds more suitable than others.

*Air genasi* are proud of their heritage, sometimes to the
point of haughtiness. They can be flamboyant, and are keen
to have an audience. They rarely stay in one place for long,
always looking for a new sky to see and breathe. Air genasi
who don’t live in cities favor open lands such as plains,
deserts, and high mountains. Fitting backgrounds include
:ref:`srd:background-charlatan`, :ref:`srd:background-entertainer`,
and :ref:`srd:background-noble`.

*Earth genasi* are more withdrawn, and their connection to
the earth keeps them from being comfortable in most cities.
Their uncommon size and strength makes them natural
soldiers, though, and with their stoic demeanor, they can
encourage others and become great leaders. Many earth
genasi live underground, where they can be in their favored
element. When they emerge from their caves, they might
roam the hills and mountains or lay claim to old ruins.
Appropriate backgrounds for earth genasi include :ref:`srd:background-hermit`,
:ref:`srd:background-outlander`, and :ref:`srd:background-soldier`.

*Fire genasi* often get themselves into difficulty with their
fiery tempers. Like their air genasi cousins, they sometimes
flaunt their perceived superiority over common folk. But they
also want others to share their high opinion of themselves,
so they constantly seek to enhance their reputations.
Likely backgrounds for a fire genasi include :ref:`srd:background-criminal`,
:ref:`srd:background-folk-hero`, and :ref:`srd:background-noble`.

*Water genasi* almost all have some experience aboard
or around sea vessels. They make excellent mariners and
fishers. Like earth genasi, though, water genasi prefer quiet
and solitude; the wide shores are their natural homes. They
go where they want, do what they want, and rarely feel bound
to anything. Good backgrounds for water genasi include
:ref:`srd:background-hermit` and :ref:`srd:background-sailor`.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age.** Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans
and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live
somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.

**Alignment.** Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend
toward a neutral alignment.

**Size.**  Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents
but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere
from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Languages.**  You can speak, read, and write Common
and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled
with harsh syllables and hard consonants.

Air Genasi
^^^^^^^^^^

As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As
changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm
to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms
rarely last long.

Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes.
A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling
the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi
speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few
display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from
their scalps.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score also increases by 1.

**Unending Breath.** You can hold your breath indefinitely while you're
not incapacitated.

**Mingle with the Wind.**  You can cast the :ref:`srd:levitate` spell
once with this trait, requiring no material components,
and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you
finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting
ability for this spell.

Earth Genasi
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel
and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You
have inherited some measure of control over earth,
reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend
to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider
your options before taking action.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one
individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have
bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging
to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how
often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as
gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black,
eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have
smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust,
a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny
embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in
their flesh, from which faint light shines.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1.

**Earth Walk.** You can move across difficult terrain made of earth
or stone without expending extra movement.

**Merge with Stone.** You can cast the :ref:`srd:pass-without-trace`
spell once with this trait, requiring no material
components, and you regain the ability to cast it this
way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your
spellcasting ability for this spell.

Fire Genasi
^^^^^^^^^^^

As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood
and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience
and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your
distinctive appearance, you exult in it.

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning
inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coalblack,
or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking
have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion,
while more exotic specimens sport actual flames
dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound
like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered.
Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of
you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make
your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness
is in a shade of red.

**Fire Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.

**Reach to the Blaze.** You know the :ref:`srd:produce-flame`
cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the
:ref:`srd:burning-hands` spell once with this trait as a 1st-level
spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when
you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting
ability for these spells.

Water Genasi
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind,
the ocean depths—all of these things call to your heart.
You wander freely and take pride in your independence,
though others might consider you selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing,
with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair.
They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green
skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge
eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might
float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some
have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song
or trickling streams.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score
increases by 1.

**Acid Resistance.** You have resistance to acid damage.

**Amphibious.** You can breathe air and water.

**Swim.** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

**Call to the Wave.** You know the :ref:`srd:shape-water` cantrip
When you reach 3rd level, you can cast
the :ref:`srd:create-or-destroy-water` spell as a 2nd-level spell
once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it
this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your
spellcasting ability for these spells.
