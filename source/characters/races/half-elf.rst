Half-Elf Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and
some that are unique to half-elves.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and
two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

**Age.** Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach
adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans,
however, often exceeding 180 years.

**Alignment.** Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven
heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression,
demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They
chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable,
or at least unpredictable.

**Size.** Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from
5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in
dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you
as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being
:ref:`srd:charmed`, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Skill Versatility.** You gain proficiency in two skills of your
choice.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one
extra language of your choice.

Half-Elf Variants (SCAG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some half-elves in Faerun have a racial trait in place of the Skill Versatility
trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf character can forgo Skill Versatility
and instead take the elf trait Keen Senses or a trait based on your elf parentage:

* A half-elf of *wood elf* descent can choose the wood elf's Elf Weapon Training,
  Fleet of Foot, or Mask of the Wild.
* A half-elf of *moon elf* or *sun elf* descent can choose the high elf's Elf Weapon
  Training or Cantrip.
* A half-elf of *drow* descent can choose the drow's Drow Magic.
* A half-elf of *aquatic* heritage can choose the swimming speed of 30 feet.
