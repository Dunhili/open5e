Halfling Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other
halflings.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally
lives into the middle of his or her second century.

**Alignment.** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are
good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no
tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional,
leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of
their old ways.

**Size.** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40
pounds. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll.

**Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being
:ref:`srd:frightened`.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any
creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The
Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with
others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of
literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all
halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they
dwell or through which they are traveling.

Ghostwise (SCAG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ghostwise halflings trace their ancestry back to a war among halfling tribes
that sent their ancestors into flight from Luiren. Ghostwise halflings are the
rarest of the *hin*, found only in the Chondalwood and a few other isolated
forests, clustered in tight-knit clans.

Many ghostwise clans select a natural landmark as the center of their territory,
and members carry a piece of that landmark with them at all times. Clan warriors
known as nightgliders bond with and ride giant owls as mounts.

Because these folk are clannish and mistrustful of outsiders, ghostwise adventurers
are rare.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score also increases by 1.

**Silient Speech.** You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you.
The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak
telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

Lightfoot
^^^^^^^^^

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using
other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well
with others.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often
dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score also increases by 1.

**Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are
obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

Stout
^^^^^

As a stout halfling, you're hardier than average and have some resistance
to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score also increases by 1.

**Stout Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and
you have resistance against poison damage.
