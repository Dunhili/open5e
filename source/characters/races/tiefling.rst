Tiefling Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal
descent.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1,
and your Charisma score increases by 2.

**Age.** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few
years longer.

**Alignment.** Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward
evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature
inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.

**Size.** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your
size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior
vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60
feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Hellish Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.

**Infernal Legacy.** You know the :ref:`srd:thaumaturgy` cantrip. When you
reach 3rd level, you can cast the :ref:`srd:hellish-rebuke` spell as a 2nd-level
spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you
finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the
:ref:`srd:darkness` spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so
when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

Tiefling Variants (SCAG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ
from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following
variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged
are mutually exclusive.

**Appearance.** Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than have
the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4 + 1 of
the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike
eyes; six fingers on each hand; goat-like legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery
or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; excude a smell of
brimstone.

**Feral.** Your intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2.
This trait replaces the Ability Score increase trait.

**Devil's Tongue.** You know the :ref:`srd:vicious-mockery` cantrip. When you reach 3rd
level, you can cast the :ref:`srd:charm-person` spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this
trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the :ref:`srd:enthrall` spell once with this
trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells again with this trait. Charisma is
your spellcasting ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.

**Hellfire.** Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the :ref:`srd:burning-hands` spell once
per day as a 2nd-level spell. This trait replaces the :ref:`srd:hellish-rebuke` spell of the
Infernal Legacy trait.

speed of 30 feet. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.
