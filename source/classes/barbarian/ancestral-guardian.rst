Path of the Ancestral Guardian (XGE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past
linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this
path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardians spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In
order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate
tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters
and other fearsome rivals. 

Ancestral Protectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 3rd level, while you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes
the target of spiritual warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that
target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature
other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect
on the target ends early if your rage ends.

Spirit Shield
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beginning at 6th level, if you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes
damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and
by 4d6 at 14th level.

Consult the Spirits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 10th level, you cast the :ref:`srd:augury` or :ref:`srd:clairvoyance` spell, without using a spell slot
or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, it invisibly summons one of your ancestral
spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

Vengeful Ancestors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 14th level, when you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an
amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.
