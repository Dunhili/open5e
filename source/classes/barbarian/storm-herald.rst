Path of the Storm Herald (XGE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed.
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal
magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to
create poweful magical effects.

Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and other sworn to protect
nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wrecked by storms, in the frozen reaches
at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

Storm Aura
~~~~~~~~~~
Starting at 3rd level, you emanate an aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every
direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on
each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that
chosen environment. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.

If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Constitution modifier.

Desert
******

All other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels
in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

Sea
***

You can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The
target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage
increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level,
and 4d6 at 20th level.

Tundra
******

Each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering.
The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level,
4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.  

Storm Soul
~~~~~~~~~~
At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active.

Desert
******

You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don't suffer the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action,
you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

Sea
***

You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.

Tundra
******

You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don't suffer the effects of extreme cold. Moreover, as an action, you
can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature
is in the cube. 

Shielding Storm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 10th level, each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature
while the creature is in your Storm Aura. 

Raging Storm
~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 14th level, the power of the storm grows mightier.

Desert
******

Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that
creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half
your barbarian level.

Sea
***

When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

Tundra
******

Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura.
That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your
next turn, as magical frost covers it.
