Order of the Ghostslayer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest and most driven of the orders, having
rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge
of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the
mysteries of the transition. Some will sit with the terminally diseased to closely witness
their passing, while others go so far as to deliberately have a near-death experience,
allowing them to tune their body and senses to the ethereal realms beyond. 

Rite of the Dawn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the esoteric rite Rite of the Dawn (detailed below).

**Rite of the Dawn.** Your rite damage is radiant type. The damage you suffer from
activating this rite is halved.

If you hit an Undead creature with your Rite of the Dawn, it suffers additional
radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Upon reaching 11th level, any creature you hit with your Rite of the Dawn suffers this
additional radiant damage.

Hallowed Veins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beginning at 7th level, your blood curses become honed to the fabric of a creature’s
essence. Your blood curses can now affect any creature, regardless of their form or lack
of blood.

In addition, when you amplify a use of your Blood Maledict feature, after rolling the amplify
damage you would sustain, you may choose to reroll the die and must use the new roll.

Supernal Surge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon reaching 11th level, you’ve learned to briefly step into the spirit world, enabling a swift
and deadly strike. When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can expend a use of this
feature to attack three times, instead of twice, and you temporarily become spectral. Until the end
of your next turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.
You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. If you are inside an object when
you are no longer spectral, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can
occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved. You may expend a use of
this feature as a bonus action instead of making an attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Gravesight
~~~~~~~~~~
At 15th level, you can see through magical darkness up to 30 feet, as well as see invisible creatures
and objects up to 30 feet.

Vengeful Spirit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon reaching 18th level, you learn to project your spirit to fight on while on the edge of death.
Whenever your hit points drop to 0, you can choose to let your soul emerge from your body to fight on.
Your body remains :ref:`srd:unconscious` and subject to death saving throws per normal. At the beginning of your
next turn, you manifest a spirit form in your space that picks up your weapons and continues fighting on,
acting on your turn and every one of your subsequent turns under your control. Your spirit form has your
physical attributes and armor class, as well as your weapons and ammunition, and can move through other
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. This form is immune to cold, necrotic, and
non-magical weapon damage. Your spirit form has access to all of your abilities and suffers no damage
from your Crimson Rite feature.

If your spirit form takes any damage, your body dies, or you regain any hit points, your spirit form vanishes.
If your spirit form vanishes, it drops your weapons in its space.
