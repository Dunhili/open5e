Blood Hunter (MM)
=================

In a landscape tormented by all manner of beasts, devils, and abominations
from beyond the veil, most live in fear of the dark, of superstition, and of
the unknown. Some grow hardened by this experience, instead choosing to stand
up and fight against the tide of shadow.

These folk are called ‘heroes.’

Some, however, are so fanatical and bent on destroying the anathema that
plagues the countryside that they embrace dark, forbidden knowledge. They
sacrifice some of their own vital force in dubious, forgotten blood rituals
to better understand their enemies. Their methods sometimes blur the line between
themselves and the evils they hunt, calling their own humanity into question.

These folk are called ‘Blood Hunters.’

Become the Enemy to Understand the Enemy
----------------------------------------

These warriors have chosen to merge the martial pursuit of deadly weapon play with
elements of vicious blood magic to create impressively effective combat techniques.
They surrender their own vitality to form a bond with their weapon, allowing them to
harness the elements in a whirlwind of dangerous strikes. Their deep knowledge and
unnatural connection with wicked creatures allows them an advantage in tracking,
hunting, and destroying even the most resilient of abhorrent fiends. By mastering
control over their own lifeblood and the lifeblood of others, they gain insight into
their foes and the ability to manipulate them from the inside. Some brew crude, poisonous
alchemical tonics from the harvested organs of felled monsters, mutating their blood and
bodies to be even further in tune with their quarry, becoming something other than human
themselves. Others go further, reaching out and making a pact with lesser dark entities
in hopes of using their grim gifts against greater evils. Many blood hunters push too far
for their goals, falling to their own hubris and becoming the monsters they’ve chosen to hunt.
This is the greatest fear of a blood hunter, and of the societies at large that shun them.

Almost as Feared as their Prey
------------------------------
The nature of their abilities and training has bred many rumors across the lands, some of
which aren’t too far from the truth. Common folk consider them cursed, often turning them
away at the door. Nobles see them as occasionally convenient, but a generally reviled
nuisance. Mages find them useful allies if kept at arm’s length, while pious clerics and
paladins keep their distance with a watchful eye. To be a blood hunter is to accept a life
of solitude until proven trustworthy and dependable.

Creating a Blood Hunter
-----------------------

.. sidebar:: Quick Build
    :class: quick-build
	
	You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength
	or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee
	weapons, or ranged and finesse weapons. Make Wisdom your next highest if you plan to focus
	on the potency of blood curses and mystical power. Choose a higher Constitution next if you
	wish to use Crimson Rite on multiple weapons or want to have extra hit points to burn on
	amplifying blood curses. Then, select the :ref:`srd:background-haunted-one`
	or :ref:`srd:background-acolyte` background.

As you create your blood hunter, keep in mind how your character relates to society and why
they have taken to a life of monster hunting. Do they wish to protect society and as such
have paid the ultimate price? Do they have a family they wish to protect at all costs? Did
they make a mistake that cost them greatly, and they wish to make amends for their folly?
Or are they bent on vengeance for some past wound or loss that drove them to choose this
dark warrior’s path?

While a blood hunter begins their journey alone, they also acknowledge the strength in
numbers and the benefits of trusted companions. Many blood hunters keep allies to both
ensure that they succeed at their hunts, and to keep a watchful eye to prevent them from
losing touch with their humanity. A blood hunter without conviction is lost, and often an
honest friend is enough to keep them from straying.

Blood Hunter Orders
-------------------

There are a handful of secretive orders of blood hunters that guard their cryptic techniques and blasphemous rituals. One must
adhere to one of these orders to even be granted access to the Hunter’s Bane rite that starts their journey, and only once
they’ve proven their ability will the secrets of the order begin to be revealed. Some even wait a few years before they are sure
they want to continue down this cursed path. Either or, it’s within these small, enigmatic sects that the real power of a blood
hunter is learned.

Class Abilities
---------------

Hunter's Bane
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the imbibing of the Hunter’s Bane, a poisonous alchemical concoction
that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, Fiends, and Undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to
recall information about them. If you are actively tracking one of these creature types, you cannot be surprised by any
creatures of that type. You can only be tracking one type of creature at a time.

Upon reaching 11th level, you can flare the internal toxic scars from the ritual, using the pain to give clarity, or promote
anger. You can choose to suffer damage equal to your crimson rite damage die to gain advantage on a Wisdom (Insight) check or
Charisma (Intimidation) check.

Crimson Rite
^^^^^^^^^^^^
At 1st level, you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to
learn one rite from the Primal Rites list below. You cannot change this choice.

As a bonus action, you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite until your next short or long rest.
While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is complete.

When a crimson rite is activated, you suffer damage equal to your character level, and you reduce your maximum hit points
by an amount equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored
otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoring of maximum hit points.

Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single
rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a separate weapon for the purposes of this feature.
A rite can be allowed to fade at any time (no action required).

You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.

Primal Rites
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Rite of the Flame** - Your rite damage is fire type.
- **Rite of the Frozen** - Your rite damage is cold type.
- **Rite of the Storm** - Your rite damage is lightning type.

Esoteric Rites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Rite of the Dead** - Your rite damage is necrotic type.
- **Rite of the Oracle** - Your rite damage is psychic type.
- **Rite of the Roar** - Your rite damage is thunder type.

Fighting Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a
Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Archery
~~~~~~~

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

Dueling
~~~~~~~

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

Great Weapon Fighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands,
you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed
or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

Two-Weapon Fighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

Blood Maledict
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At 2nd level, you gain the knowledge to further channel, and sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate
your enemies. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the “blood curses” section. You learn one additional blood
curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 5th, 9th,
13th, 16th, and 20th level.

When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the
target, you may choose to amplify the curse by suffering damage equal to a roll of your crimson rite damage die. An amplified
curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune
to blood curses (DM’s discretion).

You can use this feature once. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Beginning at 6th level, you can
use your Blood Maledict feature twice between rests, at 11th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level,
you can use it four times between rests.

Blood Curses
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The blood curses are presented in alphabetical order.

**Blood Curse of Binding**
As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind an enemy no more than one size larger than you within 30 feet. The target must succeed
on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or have their speed be reduced to 0 until
the end of your next turn.

*Amplify.* This curse becomes ongoing, and can affect a creature regardless of their size category. At the end of each of its turns,
the cursed can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends. You can end the curse whenever you like (no action
required).

**Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering**
As a bonus action, you can link to a creature within 30 feet for up to a minute, forcing them to share in the pain they inflict upon
you. The next time the cursed creature damages you with a weapon attack, this curse deals necrotic damage to the cursed creature equal
to half of the damage you suffered. This curse then ends.

*Amplify.* This curse instead deals damage equal to the damage you suffered, and it ignores necrotic resistance.

**Blood Curse of Purgation**
As a bonus action, you can manipulate the vitality of a creature within 60 feet to expunge a corruption in their blood. The target
creature can immediately make a saving throw against a poisoned condition afflicting it.

*Amplify.* Your target can instead immediately make a saving throw against one other condition afflicting it. This condition can be
blinded, deafened, or paralyzed.

**Blood Curse of Spell Sunder**
When an enemy casts a spell within 60 feet that requires a spell attack roll and targets you, you can use your reaction to rend the
spell from the air, imposing disadvantage on the spell attack roll.

*Amplify.* You make a Wisdom ability check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell misses you automatically.

**Blood Curse of the Eyeless**
When an enemy who is not immune to blindness within 60 feet makes a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on
the attack roll.

*Amplify.* Following the triggering attack, the affected enemy has disadvantage on the next attack roll they make.

**Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet**
The moment a creature falls unconscious or dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of
aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range. After the
attack, the creature returns to being unconscious or dead.

*Amplify.* You grant a bonus to the attack roll and damage roll of the cursed creature’s attack equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

**Blood Curse of the Fending Rite**
When an enemy casts a spell that requires a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to deflect the spell with your crimson rite.
You gain a bonus to the initial saving throw against that spell equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). This curse is invoked
before the saving throw is rolled.

*Amplify.* You grant all allies within 5 feet of you this bonus to their saving throw against the triggering spell as well.

**Blood Curse of the Marked**
As a bonus action, you can mark an enemy within 60 feet. Until the end of your turn, all crimson rite damage you deal to the target is doubled.

*Amplify.* You cause the marked target to also lose resistance to your rite damage type until the beginning of your next turn.

Blood Hunter Order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Mutant, Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the
Profane Soul, or Order of the Lycan, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level,
and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

Ability Score Improvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Extra Attack
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Grim Psychometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you reach 9th level, you can take 10 minutes to meditate on an object to discern vague details regarding any lingering evil or
wicked past surrounding it. Make a Wisdom ability check. Based on the result, the DM may reveal obscure information about dark events that
may have previously surrounded the object, or hints toward a sinister purpose. This feature has no effect on objects untouched by evil. An
object can only be targeted by this feature once, and future attempts reveal no further details. You cannot use this feature again until you
finish a short or long rest.

Dark Velocity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon reaching 10th level, you beckon the surrounding shadows to grant you unnatural swiftness on the battlefield. You gain darkvision out to
30 feet, or if you have darkvision, extend it out an additional 30 feet. While in dim light or darkness, your speed increases by 10 feet, and
attacks of opportunity made against you have disadvantage.

Hardened Soul
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you reach 14th level, you can no longer become frightened, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical Charm effects. 

Sanguine Mastery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon becoming 20th level, your ability to harness your pain, and the pain of your foes, is perfected. When you are below one fourth of your
current maximum hit points, all of your crimson rite damage dice are maximized.

In addition, when you critically hit with a weapon attack that bears your crimson rite, you regain a use of your Blood Maledict feature.
