Order of the Lycan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as
Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength
and hunger for violence of a wild beast. Those that shun the curse spend their lives
burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon
makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid
hybrid controlled by murderous impulse. Those that embrace the dark Nature of their curse
learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament
that drives the beast within.

The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who  undergo “The Taming”, a
ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their
abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it.
Through intense honing of one’s own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order’s blood
magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time.
Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a
terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without
care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves
to the bloodlust.

    Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the
	terrible burden it is and the challenges it brings. Where most who embrace this curse grow wicked,
	mad, even murderous, these blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control
	through intense training and blood magic. These factors enable a member of the Order of the Lycan
	to prevent the spread of their curse through blood, should they wish to. One of the most sacred
	oaths of this order is to never infect another without the order’s sanction.
	
	Should a member of the Order of the Lycan be cured of the lycanthropic curse, it is a terrible shame
	on their name, the order, and those who carry the curse still. There have been passages written about
	members being cleansed against their will, but those brothers and sisters readily return to the order
	to undergo a renewed initiation of The Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring
	their honor.

	Lycanthropy comes in many forms. Each version of the curse is bound to a specific beast: wolf, bear,
	tiger, boar, and rat are a few of the more well-known variations. The strain of the curse defines the
	beast a hybrid form will share, but the features the curse bestows remain relatively uniform across strains.

Heightened Senses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to adopt the improved abilities of a natural
predator. You gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

Hybrid Transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to learn to control the lycanthropic curse that now lives
in your blood. As an action, you can transform into your Hybrid form. This form lasts for 10 minutes. You can
speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action
on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall :ref:`srd:unconscious`, drop to 0 hit
points, or die.

The benefits of this form replace the rules for Lycanthropy within the Monster’s Manual.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. While you are
transformed, you gain the following features:

**Feral Might.** You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You also
have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**Resilient Hide.** You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that
aren’t silvered. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.

**Predatory Strikes.** Your unarmed strikes are considered a single weapon in regards to your crimson rite feature.
You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolIs of your unarmed strikes. When you use the
Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action.

Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. This die increases to 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 18th level.

**Cursed Weakness.** Your have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.

**Bloodlust.** At the start of your turn, if you’ve taken any damage since the beginning of your last turn,
you must make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control. The DC equals 10, or half of the total damage you’ve
taken from attacks since your last turn, whichever number is higher. On a failed save, you must move directly
towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. If there is more than one
possible target, the DM chooses the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn.

If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the Barbarian’s rage feature), you automatically
fail this saving throw.

Stalker's Prowess
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 7th level, your speed increases by 10 feet. You also can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your
high jump distance. In addition, your hybrid form gains the Improved Predatory Strikes feature.

*Improved Predatory Strikes.* When you have an active rite while in your hybrid form, your unarmed strikes are considered
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Advanced Transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 11th level, you learn to unleash and control more of the beast within. You can now transform into your
hybrid form as a bonus action, and your hybrid transformation now lasts for up to 30 minutes.

In addition, your hybrid form gains the Lycan Regeneration and Beastly Precision features.

**Lycan Regeneration.** At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1) if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

**Beastly Precision.** You gain a bonus to melee attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes equal to half of your
proficiency bonus (rounded down).

Iron Volition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning at 15th level, you’ve honed your willpower to better resist the violent urges of your lycanthropic curse.
Whenever you make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control of your hybrid form, you do so with advantage.

In addition, your hybrid form gains the Pack Hunter feature.

**Pack Hunter.** You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet
of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

Hybrid Transformation Mastery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 18th level, you have wrestled your inner predator and mastered it. You can now use your hybrid transformation
feature three times between rests.

You also gain the Blood Curse of the Howl for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your blood
curses known.

**Blood Curse of the Howl.** As an action, you howl at any number of creatures within 30 feet, chilling their blood and
stunning them with fear. Any of the target creatures that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal
to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If
they fail their saving throw by 5 or more, they are stunned until the end of your next turn instead. A creature that
succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.

*Amplify.* This curse can target any number of creatures within 60 feet of you.
