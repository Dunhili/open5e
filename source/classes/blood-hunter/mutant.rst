Order of the Mutant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The process of consuming the Hunter’s Bane is a painful, scarring, and often fatal experience.
Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience
exalting, embracing the ability to alter one’s own physiology through corrupted alchemy.

Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one
that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their
blood and, over time become something beyond human. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant.

Formulas
~~~~~~~~

You begin to uncover forbidden alchemical formulas that temporarily alter your mental and
physical abilities.

Beginning at 3rd level, you choose to learn three mutagen formulas. Your formula options are
detailed at the end of this order description. You gain an additional formula at 7th level, 11th
level, 15th level, and 18th level.

Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulas you already
know and replace it with another mutagen formula.

Mutagen Craft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 3rd level, you can take a short rest to concoct a single mutagen. Consuming a single mutagen
requires a bonus action, and the effects (including side effects) last until you complete a short
or long rest, or spend an action to focus and flush the toxins from your system.

Mutagens are designed for your biology. They have no effect on large or larger creatures, and only
impart the side effects on other medium or smaller creatures that drink the entire mutagen. They are
also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not swallowed before you
finish your next short or long rest.

Your body will begin to better utilize the toxins you instill it with as you grow in power and experience.
These advancing mutations may be signified by a Mutation score.

**Mutation Score** = your blood hunter level divided by 4, rounded up.

Advanced Mutagen Craft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon reaching 7th level, when you take a short rest to concoct a mutagen, you can now create two.
Mutagens must be different formulas, and can be ingested with overlapping effects that last until you
finish your next short or long rest. Each mutagen still takes a separate bonus action to imbibe.

Once you reach 15th level, you can now create three mutagens during a short rest.

Strange Metabolism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning at 11th level, you can use a bonus action to instill a burst of adrenaline to temporarily resist
the negative effects of a mutagen. You can choose to ignore the side effect of a mutagen affecting you
for 1 minute.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Robust Physiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 15th level, your body has begun to adapt to toxins and venoms, ignoring their corroding effects. You gain
immunity to poison damage and the :ref:`srd:poisoned` condition.

Advanced Mutagen Craft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon reaching 15th level, when you take a short rest to concoct a mutagen, you can now create three. Mutagens
must be different formulas, and can be ingested with overlapping effects that last until you finish your next
short or long rest. Each mutagen still takes a separate bonus action to imbibe.

Exalted Mutation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 18th level, your body has begun producing one of your toxins naturally. Choose one of your known mutagen
formulas. You gain the benefits and side effects of this mutagen permanently, at all times. You cannot change
this choice of formula after this feature is acquired.
