Order of the Profane Soul
=========================

The magics adopted by the wayward blood hunter prove formidable against many an
evil across the realm. However, the darkest of abominations draw from an ancient well
of cruel, unfathomable power. These terrors can control shadows to do their bidding, hide
in plain sight among the noblest of nobles, and bend the minds of the most stalwart
warrior with but a glance. These fiends are far trickier to hunt, and many lost their
lives in pursuit of such wickedness.

A small sect of blood hunters had finally had enough and delved into this same well of
corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater.
While they may have lost a part of themselves, the power gained far outweighed the price,
for even devils now quake when they know they’ve drawn the attention of the Order of the
Profane Soul.

Otherworldly Patron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the
:ref:`srd:warlock-archfey-archetype`, the :ref:`srd:warlock-fiend-archetype`, or the :ref:`srd:warlock-great-old-one-archetype`,
each detailed in the warlock section of the Player's Handbook, the :ref:`srd:warlock-undying-archetype`
in the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, or the :ref:`srd:warlock-celestial-archetype`
or :ref:`srd:warlock-hexblade-archetype` in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. Your choice augments
some of your order features.

The Archfey
~~~~~~~~~~~

Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were
forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable,
and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling
of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam,
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

The Celestial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean,
solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact
with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the
multiverse.

The Fiend
~~~~~~~~~

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even
if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things,
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon,
Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial;
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

The Great Old One
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come
from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends.
Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest
libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your
existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it.

The Hexblade
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell — a force that manifests in sentient
magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons,
which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer
power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in
the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.

The Undying
~~~~~~~~~~~
Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a
prize — like all power — comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the
seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of
life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen
Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus.

Pact Magic
~~~~~~~~~~

When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See
chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 in the Player's
Handbook for the Warlock spell list.

**Cantrips.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock
cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots.** The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows
what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.

To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch
bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.** At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock
spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of
1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level
column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st,
2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know
and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Wisdom
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Rite Focus
~~~~~~~~~~

Begining at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. While
you have an active rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5 of the
Player’s Handbook) for your spells. Your chosen pact also enhances your rite.

**The Archfey**
If you deal rite damage to a creature, that creature loses any half or three-quarters cover bonuses,
as well as invisibility, until the beginning of your next turn.

**The Celestial**
You can expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature as a bonus action to heal one creature within 60
feet of you. They regain hit points equal to your crimson rite damage die rolled twice + your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of 1).

**The Fiend**
While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 on your rite damage die, you may reroll the die. You
may reroll only once per attack.

**The Great Old One**
Whenever you deal a critical hit to a creature, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against
your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is :ref:`srd:frightened` of you until the end of your next turn.

**The Hexblade**
Whenever you target a creature with a blood curse, your next attack against the cursed creature is a
critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the attack.

**The Undying**
Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, and kill it, you regain
hit points equal to your crimson rite damage die.

Mystic Frenzy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as
a bonus action.

Revealed Arcana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 7th level, your dark patron grants you the rare use of a dangerous arcane spell based on your pact.

**The Archfey**
You can cast :ref:`srd:blur` once using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

**The Celestial**
You can cast :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` once using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Fiend**
You can cast :ref:`srd:scorching-ray` once using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Great Old One**
You can cast :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts` once using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Hexblade**
You can cast :ref:`srd:branding-smite` once using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Undying**
You can cast :ref:`srd:blindness-deafness` once using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

Diabolic Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 11th level, you can temporarily infuse your rite with the seed of a powerful spell. As an action,
you can imbue your rite-enhanced weapon with one warlock spell you can cast or is already active, then
make a single attack with that weapon. The spell must be using a warlock or profane soul spell slot.
If that attack hits, all spell attack rolls for the imbued spell hit the target automatically and are
considered part of the single weapon attack. The target takes weapon damage, and is subject to the
effects of the spell, expending a spell slot accordingly. If the attack has advantage, the target’s
initial saving throw against the spell has disadvantage. If the attack misses, the spell has no effect.
Area spells originate from the target’s space. 

The spell must be of 1st level or higher, have a casting time of 1 action, or require an action to
activate an already active concentration spell.

Unsealed Arcana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 15th level, your dark patron grants you the rare use of an additional arcane spell based on 
your pact.

**The Archfey**
You can cast :ref:`srd:slow` once without using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Celestial**
You can cast :ref:`srd:revivify` once without using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Fiend**
You can cast :ref:`srd:fireball` once without using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Great Old One**
You can cast :ref:`srd:haste` once without using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Hexblade**
You can cast :ref:`srd:blink` once without using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

**The Undying**
You can cast :ref:`srd:bestow-curse` once without using a profane soul spell slot. You can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

Soul Syphon
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you reach 18th level, your learn to sacrifice the souls of powerful foes to your dark patron in
exchange for immediate power. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, kill the creature,
and they have a challenge rating of 15 or above, you recover an expended spell slot.
