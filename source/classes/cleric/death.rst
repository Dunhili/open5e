Death Domain (DMG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Death Domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities
such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain
also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the Underworld
(Hades and Hel).

Bonus Proficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

Reaper
~~~~~~~~~~

At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip that
noramally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. 

Channel Divinity: Touch of Death
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch.

When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals
5 + twice his or her cleric lvel. 

Inescapable Destruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 6th level, the cleric's ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character's cleric spells and
Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

Divine Strike
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.

Improved Reaper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target
two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, the cleric must provide them for each target.
