Battle Master
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques
passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic
field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weapon smithing and
calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and
artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who
do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

Combat Superiority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled
by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under
"Maneuvers" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one
maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time
you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority dice is expended
when you use it. You regain all expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the
maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

  **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
  
Student of War

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Know Your Enemy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature
ouside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM
tells you if the creature is equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics
of your choice:

* Strength Score
* Dexterity Score
* Constitution Score
* Armor Class
* Current Hit Points
* Total class levels (if any)
* Fighter Class levels (if any)

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining,
you regain 1 superiority dice. 

Maneuvers

The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one

superiority die.That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to
the attack’s damage roll.

Cavalier (XGE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at
court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state
dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the
protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many
of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.

Bonus Proficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills
of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you
learn one language of your choice.

Born to the Saddle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving
throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than
10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.

Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half
your speed.

Unwavering Mark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for
harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until
the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone
else marks the creature.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll
that doesn't target you.

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a
special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You
have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the
target equal to half your fighter level.

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times
equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when
you finish a long rest.

Warding Maneuver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby.
If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a
reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to
the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the
attack's damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once),
and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Hold the Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity
attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with
an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

Ferocious Charger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at
least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that
target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier)
or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

Vigilant Defender
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a
special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this
special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you
take your normal reaction.
