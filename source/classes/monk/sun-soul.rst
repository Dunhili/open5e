Way of the Sun Soul (SCAG, XGE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash
the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.

Radiant Sun Bolt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance.

You gain a ranged spell attack that you can use with the Attack action. The attack has a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity
modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts
column of the Monk table.

When you use the Attack action on your turn to use this special attack, you can spend 1 ki point to make two additional attacks with it as a bonus action.

Searing Arc Strike
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki
points to cast the 1st-level spell :ref:`srd:burning-hands` as a bonus action. 

You can spend additional ki points to cast :ref:`srd:burning-hands` as a higher level spell. Each additional ki point you spend increases the spell's level by 1.
The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level (round down).

Searing Sunburst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose
within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature
is behind total cover that is opaque.

You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.

Sun Shield
~~~~~~~~~~

At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish
or restore the light as a bonus action.

If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage
equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.
