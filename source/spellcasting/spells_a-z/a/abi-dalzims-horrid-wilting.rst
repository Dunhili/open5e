Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting (EE, XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of sponge)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Casting Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube
centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in
that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and
undead aren’t affected, and plants and water elementals make this
saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 10d8 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
