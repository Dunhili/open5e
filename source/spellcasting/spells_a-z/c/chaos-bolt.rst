**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage.
After you roll the damage, choose one of the d8s. The number rolled determines damage type.

=====  =================
d8     Damage Type

3      Fire
4      Force
5      Lightning

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the energy leaps to a different creature of your
choice within 30 feet of the target. Make a new attack and damage roll.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

**At Higher Levels:** Each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
