A creature you can see must make a Wisdom save, and has advantage if you or your companions
are fighting it. If it fails, it's :ref:`srd:charmed` by you until the spell ends or until you or your
companions harm it. The charmed creature is friendly to you. When the spell ends, the creature
knows it was charmed by you.

The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other.
