.. _srd:druid-grove:

Druid Grove (XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (Mistletoe harvested with golden sickles
under full moon light; consumed)

**Duration:** 24 hours

**Casting Classes:** Druid

You protect an area outdoors or underground as small as a 30-foot cube
or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded
from the area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a
year, the spell lasts until dispelled.

The spell creates the following effects. When you cast this spell, you
can specify creatures who are immune to the effects. You can also make a
password that makes whoever says it immune to these effects.

The entire area radiates magic. :ref:`srd:dispel-magic` removes one effect, not the
entire area. The caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all effects
are gone is the grove dispelled.

* **Solid Fog:** You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with
  thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. Every
  foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to
  this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like mist.
* **Grasping Undergrowth:** You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the
  ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they
  were an :ref:`srd:entangle` spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the plants feel
  soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats and beds.
* **Grove Guardians:** You animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to
  uproot themselves. They have the same statistics as an awakened tree, except
  they can't speak and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If a creature
  not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the guardians fight them until
  they have driven off or killed the intruders. The guardians also obey your spoken
  commands that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and
  no intruders are present, the guardians do nothing. The guardians can't leave
  the warded area. When the spell ends, they are no longer animated and take root
  again if possible.
* **Additional Spell Effect.** You can place your choice of one of the following
  magical effects. To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a gentle breeze
  and the Spike Growth is harmless.
  
   * A constant :ref:`srd:gust-of-wind` in two locations of your choice
   * :ref:`srd:spike-growth` in one location of your choice
   * :ref:`srd:wind-wall` in two locations of your choice
