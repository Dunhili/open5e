Enemies Abound (XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Casting Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You force one creature you can see to make an Intelligence save. It
automatically succeeds if it's immune to being :ref:`srd:frightened`. On a failure,
the target regards all creatures it can see as enemies, allies included.
Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the
effect on a success.

Whenever the creature chooses a target, it must choose at random from
among the creatures it can see within range. If an enemy provokes an
opportunity attack, the creature must make that attack if it's able to.
