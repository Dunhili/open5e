Holy Weapon (XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

**Casting Classes:** Cleric, Paladin

Until the spell ends, a weapon you touch emits bright light in a
30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Attacks made
with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If it isn't already
a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a bonus action, you can dismiss the spell and cause the weapon to
emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can
see within 30 feet of you [1] must make a Constitution save. On a
failure, it takes 4d8 radiant damage and it is blinded for 1 minute.
On a successful save, it takes half damage and isn't blinded. At the
end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution
save, ending the blindness on a success.
