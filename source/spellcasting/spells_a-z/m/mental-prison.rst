Mental Prison (XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.

**Casting Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

One creature you can see must make an Intelligence save. The target
succeeds automatically if it's immune to being :ref:`srd:charmed`. On a success,
the target takes 5d10 psychic damage and the spell ends. On a failed
save, it takes the damage and suffers additional effects. It can't see
or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's duration.
If it's moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or
reaches any part of its body through it, it takes 10d10 psychic damage,
and the spell ends.
