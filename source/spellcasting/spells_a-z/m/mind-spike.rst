Mind Spike (XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.

**Casting Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Choose one creature you can see. The target must pass a Wisdom
saving throw or take 3d8 psychic damage. It takes half as much
on a success. On a failed save, you also always know the target's
location, but only while the two of you are on the same plane. The
target can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it
gains no benefits from this condition against you.

**At Higher Levels:** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
