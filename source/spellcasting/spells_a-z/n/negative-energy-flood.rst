Negative Energy Flood (XGE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, M (Broken bone, square of black silk)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Casting Classes:** Warlock, Wizard

A creature you can see must make a Constitution save. On a
failed save, it takes 5d12 necrotic damage. On a success, it
takes half as much. A creature killed by this spell becomes a
zombie at the start of your next turn and attacks whatever
creature it can see that is closest to it.

If the target is undead, it instead gains half of 5d12 in
temporary hit points.
