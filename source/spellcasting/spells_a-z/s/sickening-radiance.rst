Dim light spreads within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a
point. The light spreads around corners and lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time or
starts its turn there, it must pass a Constitution save or take 4d10
radiant damage, suffer one level of exhaustion, and emit a dim light
in a 5-foot radius that prevents invisibility. The light and exhaustion
go away when the spell ends.
