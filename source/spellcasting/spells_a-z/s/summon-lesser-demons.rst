**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (Vial of blood from humanoid killed in past 24 hours)

You summon demons from the Abyss. Roll to determine what appears.

=====  ======================
d6     Demons Summoned
=====  ======================
1-2    Two demons of challenge rating 1 or lower
3-4    Four demons of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
5-6    Eight demons of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
=====  ======================

The DM chooses the demons and you choose where they appear from
spaces you can see. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to
0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The demons are hostile to everyone, including you. Roll initiative
for the demons as a group. The demons pursue and attack the nearest
non-demons.

As part of casting, you can make a circle on the ground with the
material blood. The circle encompasses your space. The demons can't
cross or harm the circle, or target anyone in it. Using the blood
this way consumes it.

**At Higher Levels:** You summon twice as many demons with a 6th
or 7th-level slot. With 8th or 9th level, you summon three times as many.
