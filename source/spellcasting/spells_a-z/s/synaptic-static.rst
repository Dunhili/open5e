5th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Casting Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a
point must make an Intelligence save. A creature with an
Intelligence score of 2 or lower is immune. A target takes 8d6
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

On a failed save, for one minute it rolls a d6 and subtracts
the number from all its attacks, ability checks, and concentration
saves. It can repeat the save at the end of its turns.
