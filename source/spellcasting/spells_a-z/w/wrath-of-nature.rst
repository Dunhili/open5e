5th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Casting Classes:** Druid, Ranger

Choose a point you can see. Spirits cause trees, rocks, and
grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become
animated until the spell ends.

* **Grasses and Undergrowth:** Any area in the cube covered by grass or
  undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.
* **Trees:** At the start of your turns, enemies within 10 feet of any
  tree in the cube must pass a Dexterity save or take 4d6 slashing damage.
* **Roots and Vines:** At the end of your turns, one creature of your
  choice that is on the ground must pass a Strength save or become :ref:`srd:restrained`
  until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make an
  Athletics check against your spell save DC. A success frees it.
* **Rocks:** As a bonus action, you can cause a loose rock to launch at a
  creature you can see. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, the target takes
  3d8 bludgeoning damage, and must pass a Strength save or fall :ref:`srd:prone`.
